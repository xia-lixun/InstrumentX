  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

--------------------
WARNING:LIT:702 - PAD symbol "processing_system7_0_PS_SRSTB_pin" is not
   constrained (LOC) to a specific location.
WARNING:Place:1399 - A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair. The clock
   IOB component <fsl_i2s_0_i2s_bck_pin> is placed at site <V15>. The
   corresponding BUFGCTRL component <fsl_i2s_0_i2s_bck_pin_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed
   at site <BUFGCTRL_X0Y4>. The clock IO can use the fast path between the IOB
   and the Clock Buffer if the IOB is placed on a Clock Capable IOB site that
   has dedicated fast path to BUFGCTRL sites in its half of the device (TOP or
   BOTTOM). You may want to analyze why this problem exists and correct it. This
   is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on
   COMP.PIN <fsl_i2s_0_i2s_bck_pin.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This
   constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.
   The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor
   timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in
   the design.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
1138 block(s) removed
 282 block(s) optimized away
2479 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

The signal "SensorMP_i/net_vcc0" is loadless and has been removed.
 Loadless block "SensorMP_i/XST_VCC" (ONE) removed.
The signal "SensorMP_i/microblaze_0_axi_ipc_M_BID" is loadless and has been
removed.
The signal "SensorMP_i/microblaze_0_axi_ipc_M_ARSIZE[2]" is loadless and has
been removed.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
