WARNING:Place:1399 - A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair. The clock
   IOB component <fsl_i2s_0_i2s_bck_pin> is placed at site <V15>. The
   corresponding BUFGCTRL component <fsl_i2s_0_i2s_bck_pin_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed
   at site <BUFGCTRL_X0Y4>. The clock IO can use the fast path between the IOB
   and the Clock Buffer if the IOB is placed on a Clock Capable IOB site that
   has dedicated fast path to BUFGCTRL sites in its half of the device (TOP or
   BOTTOM). You may want to analyze why this problem exists and correct it. This
   is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on
   COMP.PIN <fsl_i2s_0_i2s_bck_pin.PAD> allowing your design to continue. This
   constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN.
   The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor
   timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in
   the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
